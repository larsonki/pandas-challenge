# City School District Standardized Test Report & Analysis

Analyze the district-wide standardized test results for City School District. Data on each students' score was imported and aggregated below to show trends within each school's performance.

## Observations:

### 1. Schools with more than 2000 students have a significant drop-off in scores passing both math and reading compared to schools with less than 2000 students. It appears students in smaller schools (<2000) are more successful on the standardized tests.

### 2. Charter schools have higher overall passing scores when compared to district schools.
